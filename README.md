**Quiz Game with Money Locking Feature**
This is a simple Python quiz game where players answer programming-related questions and win virtual money based on their correct answers. The game includes a money-locking mechanism at specific milestone questions to ensure players don't lose all their money after a wrong answer.

Features:
11 Multiple-choice questions: Related to programming languages and their developers.
Money Locking Mechanism:
Players' winnings are locked at ₹7,000,000 after correctly answering the 4th question.
Winnings are locked again at ₹50,000,000 after correctly answering the 10th question.
If a player gives a wrong answer after these milestones, they revert to the last locked amount rather than losing everything.
